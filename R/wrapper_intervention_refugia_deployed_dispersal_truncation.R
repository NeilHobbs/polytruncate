#'@title Wrapper to allow mosquito dispersal tracking in the intervention site when the insecticide is deployed
#'
#'@param insecticide.population.suppression = The impact of insecticides on the relative population size of female mosquitoes the intervention site, who are now ready to lay eggs.

#'@param female.fitness.cost = The fixed fitness cost associated with polygenic resistance for females.
#'@param male.fitness.cost = The fixed fitness cost associated with polygenic resistance for males.
#'@param female.insecticide.exposure = Proportion of female mosquitoes in the intervention site that encounter and are exposed to the deployed insecticide.
#'@param male.insecticide.exposure = Proportion of male mosquitoes in the intervention site that encounter and are exposed to the deployed insecticide as a proportion of the exposure of female mosquitoes
#'@param standard.deviation = The standard deviation of the trait mean in the population.
#'@param vector.length = The length of the vector to be returned. A minimum value of 100,000 is recommmended.
#'@param maximum.bioassay.survival.proportion = The maximum proportion of mosquitoes that can survive in the bioassay.
#'@param michaelis.menten.slope = The slope in the Michaelis-Menten equation
#'@param half.population.bioassay.survival.resistance = The Polygenic Resistance Score which gives a 50% survival probability in a WHO cylinder bioassay.
#'@param regression.coefficient = A linear model coefficient obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.
#'@param regression.intercept = The linear model intercept obtained from performing a linear model on paired experimental hut trials and WHO cylinder bioassays.
#'@param current.insecticide.efficacy = The insecticide efficacy of insecticide i at time since deployment Ï„ defined as proportion of fully susceptible mosquitoes surviving contact with the insecticide-treated surface.,
#'@param exposure.scaling.factor = A factor which converts the insecticide exposure to the selection differential.
#'@param heritability = The heritability of a polygenic trait.
#'@param dispersal.rate = The rate of mosquito exchange between the intervention site and the refugia.
#'@param intervention.coverage = The proportion of the total mosquito population that is covered by the intervention site.
#'@param refugia.before.selection = The mean Polygenic Resistance Score of the mosquito population in the refugia  before selection has occurred that generation.
