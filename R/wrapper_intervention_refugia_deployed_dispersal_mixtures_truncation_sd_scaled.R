#'@param female.insecticide.exposure = Proportion of female mosquitoes in the intervention site that encounter and are exposed to the deployed insecticide.

#'@param standard.deviation = The standard deviation of the trait mean in the population.
#'@param vector.length = The length of the vector to be returned. A minimum value of 100,000 is recommmended.
