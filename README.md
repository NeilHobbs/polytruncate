Quantatative Genetic Modelling for Polygenic Insecticide Resistance: Truncated Selection

With truncation selection we expect on the most resistant individuals in the population to survive. E.g. If the mean bioassay survival of the population was 5%, it would be the individuals with the top 5% polygenic resistance scores who survive.
